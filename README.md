## Database Design
ðŸ’¡ **TODO:** 
- [ ] add database schema diagram
- [ ] update the below data to reflect the up-to-date datase design in the application

<details>
  <summary>
    the entity classes of the database this application are: User, Address, Product, Review, Rating, Category, QtyPerSize, Cart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, Payment.

    the entity classes that represent many tables (self-referencing relationships): Category ("category" and "sub_category" tables).
    the many-to-many relationship tables are: no many-to-many relationships in this project yet.
    the supporting/"weak"-entity tables are: address, qty_per_size, image.
    the enumerated helper classes: Role, OrderStatus, ProductSize, RatingValue, PaymentMethod.
    the record classes: Image.
